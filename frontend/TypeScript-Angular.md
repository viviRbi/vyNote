# Type Script / Angular

## Access modifiers
- In TypeScript, we have 3 keywords for access modifiers: public, private and protected
- By default, all members of class (fields, methods) are public (able to access outside a class) 
- Private: only within a class
- Protected: within the class or the extended class
