Java
Basics
### Java is pass by value. A variable that holds an object will be stored in the stack, with a pointer to that object in the heap
## What is Java? / Explain some features of Java
Java:
- Java is a high-level, compiled, strongly typed object-oriented programming (OOP) language.

- High-level: Code that is easily human readable, as opposed to binary or assembly.
- Hybrid between compiled and interpreted language: Human-readable code is compiled, or transformed, into a form more optimized for computers to read
- For example, C++ code is compiled into binary
- Java code on the other hand is compiled into Java byte-code, which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will then interpret this byte-code and essentially run the program.
- Strongly-typed: variables declared of a certain type can only have values assigned to it of that same type

- Features:
- Java is Platform Independent. WORA. It is also a compiled and interpreted language: 
	- Unlike C which compile to binary and can only excute code for a particular machine, 
	- Java convert code into Java Bytecode and sent to Java Virtual mechine which resides in the RAM of any operating system. JMV recognizes its platform and convert that bytecode into that platform native machine code 
- Java comes up with garbage collected by default:
	- In C and C++, programmer is responsible for both the creation and destruction of objects. If programmer forget, the application suffer from memory leaks. Method like free() in C and delete() in C++ will perform garbage collector
	- In Java, Gabarge collector happens automatically. Over the life time of a Java application, some objects will no longer needed, . At that time the heap memory consist of 2 object types: Live & Dead. The Garbage Collector find these unused obj and free up the memory
- Java has the 2nd fastest compiler (JIT - Just in Time)
- Java support multithreaded (parallel programming) which makes the program runs faster which is more preferable in the market. 
	- By default all Java thread is single threaded. To enable multi-thread, we have 2 ways:
		- Extends java.lang.Thread class
		- Implementing java.lang.Runnable interface (prefer)

```java
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  // TODO Auto-generated method stub
  GuruThread3 threadguru1 = new GuruThread3("guru1");
  threadguru1.start();
  GuruThread3 threadguru2 = new GuruThread3("guru2");
  threadguru2.start();
 }
}
class GuruThread2 implements Runnable {..}

// 2 thread runs at the same time. If 1 thread slowdown, other will take place
```

## What is JRE / JDK / JVM?
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Enables a computer to run Java programs. It essentially behaves like an interpreter or just-in-time compiler (JIT) which takes bytecode and translate it to something the computer can understand.
	- We have different implementations of the JVM for different operating systems: Linux, Windows, Mac, etc..
	- The important thing to take away from this is that this allows you to run the same bytecode on any operating system (platform independence)
- JRE (Java runtime environment): Contains the JVM and core libraries that our code may be calling and using. If the only thing we need to do is run Java programs, all we need to install is the JRE.
- JDK (Java development kit): contains the JRE (which of course contains the JVM) + developer tools like the compiler (javac), debugger, documentation tools (javadoc), and other command-line utilities

## What is the difference between an object and a class?
- Class is a blue print of an object
- Object is an instance of a class where it contains and a real world entity that exists like car1, person1.

## What is the root class from which every class extends?
- The Object class

## What are the primitive data types in Java?
- Boolean, Integer, Byte, Short, Double, Float, Char
- By default: 0 for int, 0 for byte, 0.0 for float

## Where are Strings stored?
- Strings are stored on the Heap area in a separate memory location known as String Constant pool
- When we create another String obj as ```String str2 = "Hello"```,JVM look at the string pool, if it's already exist, JVM gives its variable which stored on the stack the same address 

## Explain stack vs heap
- Stack and Heap are 2 ways Java allocated their memory
- If Java variable and method were to declare the same time in an Java app, it'll cost lots of RAM that the application maybe bloated (too much).
- That's why Java Virtual Machine divide memory between Stack Memory and Heap Space
- **Heap space**: Create by the JVM when it starts and the memory used as long as the app running.
	- When an obj created, it is always created in the Heap. Java Runtime use it to allocate memory to bject. It had a global access to be reference everywhere in the app
	- The main objective of a Garbage collector is to free the heap space by clear un-used object
- **Stack Memory**: Only use for the method that are currently running. When the method return, everything discard. This is the temporary memory where variables are stored when their methods are invokes. After the method finished, the memory contain those value is cleared.
	 - If a new instance of an object is created. The pointer to that object in the heap stored in the stack

## Are variable references stored on the stack or heap? What about the objects they refer to?
- If a new instance of an object is created. The pointer to that object in the heap stored in the stack

## What is a stack frame? When are these created?
- It is a frame of data of a function that haven't return that was pushed to the stack
- When a function called, a stack frame created. And then all the data put onto the stack frame. When the function return, the current stack frame deleted from the stack

## What are annotations?
- Provide the extra information of a method source code
- Ex: @override

## What is a POJO vs a bean?
- Plain old Java Object: ordinary Java obj 
- The only difference between both the classes is Java make java beans objects serialized so that the state of a bean class could be preserved in case required. So due to this a Java Bean class must either implements Serializable or Externalizable interface.

## Can you force garbage collection in Java? When is an object eligible for GC?
- System.gc() Runtime.gc() but should be avoid since there is no way to predict when garbage collectior will occur at runtime (non-deterministic)
- Force garbage collector best practice is to set flags on the JVM, a flag can adjust when a garbage collector will be use like set the initial and maximum size of the heap, the size of the heap sections (Young genration, old generation - younf one that lives long enough) (set flag using the CMD -command prompt)

## Why are strings immutable in java? How would you make your own objects immutable?
- Because String class was made final. 
- Performent: String pool is possible only because String is immutatable in Java. It saves a lot of heap space because different String variable can refer to the same String variable in the pool.
- Security: It will impact security for ex: dabase username and password are pass as String. If it were mutable, hacker could change the reference to cause security issues
- Multithread: String are safe for multithread because it's immutable
- To made our own object immutable, we declared our class as final

## What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer?
String | String Buffer | String Buider
----- | ----- | ------
a final class(thread safe)| synchronized(thread safe) | non-synchonized (not thread-safe)
immutable | mutable | mutable
use new keyword or = sign to create | new keyword to create an obj only| new keyword to create an obj only
-- | less efficent than String Builder | More efficent than String Buffer, faster

## What are the different variable scopes in Java?
1. Static Scope
    - Static scope refers to a variable that belongs to the class itself
2. Instance Scope
    - Instance scope referes to a variable that belongs to a particular instance/object
    - Instance methods can access static fields/methods! (directly)
3. Method Scope
    - Refers to variables defined within a method
    - Once the method finishes executing (when the method returns), then the variable will no longer be in scope
4. Block Scope
    - Refers to a block of code within a method
    - For example, variables declared inside an if statement code block, for loop block, while loop block, etc.

# Collections / Generics
## Look at if it's a class or an interface first, then look at which interface it implements from
## What are collections in Java?
- All collections are part of java.util package
- A wide variable type of collection, each have their own specialize
- All collections are dynamic, resizable, accepts only object, Iterable, the root interface of all collection (except Map) is Collection

## Some method of the Collection interface
- contains, containsAll (return true if contain all member of other collection)
- remove, removeAll (remove all elements contain on other collection)
- retainAll (remove all elements contain NOT on other collection)
- size(), clear(), isEmpty(), add(), addAll()


## What are the interfaces in the Collections API?
- List, Map, Set, Queue, etc

## What is the difference between a Set and a List?
Set | List
----- | -----
lood like dynamic unique array | exactly like array but dynamic
had no position | maintains order of insertion
not allow duplication. Check using equals & hashedCode method | allow duplications
allow 1 null | not allow any null
Implemented by HashedSet, LinkedHashedSet, TreeSet
Set implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet | List implemented in ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack classes
Set is unindexed (no position of element) | List is indexed. It had position for all the value
Memory by default 16 allocations and load factor is .75  | Memory decide by its implemented class


## What is the difference between an Array and an ArrayList?
Array | ArrayList
basic functionality of Java | Part of the collection framework
stored any | Stored referent type
not dynamic | dynamic
access using [] with index position | use its method to access (add, get)
Default capacity of an array is length we give it when it created and it's fixed | the default capability of an arrayList is 10. Once filled, new capacity =(current capacity*3)/2+ 1
Use for loop to iterate | use an Iterator to interate over an array

## What is the difference between ArrayList and Vector?
Both implemet list interface and and provide the same functionalities. However there are some differences:
ArrayList | Vector
------ | ------
Not thread safe (inconsitent result in multithreading, an use ```Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList(arrayList1));```  to archive threadsafe) | Thread safe (in Multithreading, when work on the same data, a thread will prevent another thread perform on that data -> thread safe)
by default 10 memory location. Once filled, new capacity =(current capacity*3)/2+1 | by default 10 memory locations once it is filled it will give 10 more
contiguous (meaning data stored with no discontinuities and no padding between them. If memory is so little that only smaller pieces are free, this memory allocation cannot be sastisfy. Faster execution) | not contiguous (allocates separate blocks of memory, fit into small free sapce, reduce waste of memory, slower in excecution)
newer | older

## What is the difference between TreeSet and HashSet?
TreeSet | HashedSet
------ | ------
implements Set, SortedSet, NavigableSet | implements Set

maintain data in sorted order. Compare them by implement Comparable interface inside the object class and use compareTo method. If it's just Integer or String, asc by default. It had decendingSet and decendingIterator method to reverse the sort | un-order

no null allow (since it use a Comparator, If something compare to null, a NullPointException will be throw) | allow one null (since hashedSet use hashedMap internally and null value added as a key with a dummy empty value, hashedMap check for null key and doesn't hashed the null key)
not thread safe | not thread safe
slower | faster
internally use TreeMap to stored alement. | internally use HashMap to store element. It instatiate HashMap in the constructor, pass it to a variable name map. When we use hashSet.add("123"), internally, it call map.("123",with a dummy value call PRESENT) and then added to the HashMap instance. The dummy PRESENT is just a ```public static final Object PRESENT = new Object();```


## What is the difference between HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap and HashTable both implement Map. They stored key/value pairs in a hashTable. When use, we specify a key and value object. The key is then hashed and that hash code then used as index of the value
HashTable | HashMap
----- | ------
Thread safe, synchronized | Not thread safe, not synchronized
Doesn't allow null key or value (since the key obj had to implement hashcode method and equals, and if the value null then the put method'll throw NullPointerException)| allow one null key and multiple null value
old | advance version of HashTable
doesn't maintain order of insertion | doesn't maintain order of insertion but have a subclass HashLinkedList which is ordered

``` Everthing named Listed is either have index or mantain order. List interface had indexes. Other mantains value```
## LinkedHashMap<K,V> class
- Its child of HashMap, so it gets all the props of Map and HashMap.
- Only difference is it maintains the order of insertion.

## LinkedHashSet<E> class
- It is a subclass of HashSet
- The only difference is it uses DoublyLinkedList internally to maintains the order of insertion.

## LinkedList<E> class
- LinkedList implements List,Queue and Dequeue.
- It isnt thread safe class.
- It allocates only one memory at a time. When new element comes in it will create one more.
- Memory is not contiguous.
- Insertion and Deletion is much faster here than other classes. We can use Deque (Double End Queue)(implements from Queue Interface) to add.., get.., removeFirst and Last method

## Stack class
- Stack class extends from Vector (Vector implements List interface)
- It provide pop push peek (at the top item) and a method to test if the stack is empty, and a method to search to see how an item for from the top 

## Are Maps in the Collections API? What makes Map different from other interfaces?
- Map is a part of collections but not under Collection API since its Interface doesn't extends from Collection Interface
- It comes with a key value pairs
- It is unindexed and unordered
- Map implemted in HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap and HashTable classes

## List several ways to iterate over a Collection. How would you iterate over a Map?
- Enhance for loop (```for (datatype variable : collection_used)```)
- Iterator ```for (Iterator variable = collection.iterator(); variable.hasNext();)```
- Simple for loop
- ForEach: ```colections.forEach(datatype name -> System.out.println(name))```

## What is the purpose of the Iterable interface? What about Iterator?
- Able to use .forEach(..=>..) and .interator()
- Iterator is an Interface used to stored a collection that call the interator method. Some of its method are hasNext(), next(), remove()

## What is the difference between the Comparable and Comparator interfaces?
- Java provide 2 interfaces to sort objects using data members of the class: Camparable and Comparator
- Comparable implemented by a class. It had a compareTo(Obj obj2) method. Used when there is only 1 way to sort the object
- Comparator doesn't afftect the original class. It is compare() method. Used when you want to sort the objects in multiple ways
```java
class Sortbyroll implements Comparator<Student> {
    // Used for sorting in ascending order of
    // roll number
    public int compare(Student a, Student b)
    {
        return a.rollno - b.rollno;
    }
}
```

## What are generics? What is the diamond operator (<>)? 
- Generics allow the author of a class to use type parameters, which are symbols that can be substituted for any concrete type. Ex: Map<K,V>, List <T>. Or we can create our own Generic type which is Triple <K, V, I>
- The diamon operature is where you declare the datatype of the type parameter 

## Create and instantiate a generic class. Create and use a generic method.
```java
public class Pair<T,S>{
	private final T firstVar;
	private final S secondVar;

	public printValue{
		System.out.println("First value is "+ firstVar.toString() + 
		" Second value is " + secondVar.toString());
	}
}

Pair<String, Integer> pair1 = new Pair<>("a",1)
pair1.printValue()

Pair<Person, Place> pair2 = new Pair<>(new Person("a"), new Place("River"))
pair2.printValue()
```


# Threads
## What is multi-threading?
- Multi threading means there will be 2 to more task running at the same time. It makes our app faster and smarter. Faster is always smore preferable in the market. When in a multithread, we cannot identify which thread comming first and last
## In what ways can you create a thread?
There are 2 ways of create a thread in Java: 
- Extending java.lang.Thread class (which already implement Runnable interface)
- Implement java.lang.Runnable
## List the methods in the Thread class and Runnable interface
- Runnable interface: run
- Thread class: getName (name of thread), start, run, sleep, yield, join, isAlive
## Explain the lifecycle of a thread
- A thread, acording to Sun, have 4 states: new, runable, non-runable, terminated
## What is deadlock?
## What is the synchronized keyword?

## Compile time and Runtime 
- compile time is a phase wherein the java compiler converts the java program into java bytecode
- the java compiler can't compile the code, often because of syntax errors


# IO / Serialization
## What is serialize in Java
When we serialize an obj in Java, we convert the data into byte streams that then later convert back into the copy of the original data

## How do you serialize / deserialize an object in Java?
- To serialize an obj in Java, we implement Serializable interface.
- JVM skips transient variables during the serialization process. That means the value of the age variable is not stored when the object is being serialized.
- Create file output stream, object output stream and use its write object methode then close all stream
```java
Student st = new Student("ABC","HighSchool");

FileOutputStream fileOutStr =  new FileOutputStream("student.ser");	
	 
//Create object output stream and write object
ObjectOutputStream objOutStr = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOutStr);
objOutStr.writeObject(st);

//Close all streams
objOutStr.close();
fileOutStr.close();
```

- To deserialize, use File Input Stream, Object input stream, and readObject() method of Object input stream then close all the stream

## What is a Marker interface? What does Serializable interface do?
- Marker interface is an interface with nothing inside. Example of it is the Serializable interface, Clonnable interface, Remote interface
- Ex: Serializable interface. It is used to mark that an object is eligiable for saving its state inside a file.

## What are transient variables?
- JVM skips transient variables during the serialization process. That means the value of the trainsient variable is not stored when the object is being serialized.

## Difference between FileReader and BufferedReader?
File Reader and BufferedReader ar eused to read data from a given character stream
BufferedReader | FileReader
---- | ----
Read characters from any input | Can be used only for reading files
Use Buffere internally to read | Directly read from hard drive
Faster | Slower
More efficient | Less efficient
Can read a single character or a line at a time | Can only read one character at a time, cannot read line

## Explain the try-with-resources syntax
- try-with-resouces will close the resource immediately after use
- Its syntax is
```java
try (resource declaration){

} catch (ExceptionType err){}

String line;

try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("test.txt"))) {
      while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println("Line =>"+line);
      }
} catch (IOException e) {
      System.out.println("IOException in try block =>" + e.getMessage());
    }
```

## List some methods in the Scanner class
- nextInt(), nextLine(), nextLong(), boolean hasNext(), close() 


# Exceptions
## What is the difference between final, .finalize(), and finally?
- final : cannot change a variable value anymore. Compile time error. It is a keyword
- finally is a block of code that goes together with the try block. It'll executed despite of exception is catch or not. It is a block
- Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. It is also use to release resources used by objects before they're removed from the memory. The time hen finalizer called are out of our control. It is a method
- If a finalizer throws an exception, the finalization process stops, leaving the object in a corrupted state without any notification
- Finalizer had ugly side effects at runtime. Deprecate since Java 9, will soon be remove

## Explain throw vs throws vs Throwable
- throws used to throw multiple exceptions at the method level to the calling method. It is used to force programmer handle it
- throw used to create the exception obj of our own to throw our own customised exception with our customised message

## Do you need a catch block? Can you have more than 1? Is there an order to follow?
- If we have a try block and didn't want to have a finally block, there must be a catch block
- Able to catch multiple block
- The order of a catch block is whatever matches first, gets executed 

## Compiler vs Runtime
- Compile time is a phase wherein the java compiler converts the java program into java bytecode. In other words java source code get's converted in to .class file
- In runtime, the java virtual machine loads the .class file in memory and executes that to generate the output

## Compiler error an runtime error
- Compile time error - the java compiler can't compile the code, often because of syntax errors
- the code did compile, can be executed but crashes at some point, like you have a division by zero

## What is base class of all exceptions? What interface do they all implement?
- Throwable is the base class of all exceptions (Exception, Error class extends from it) (RuntimeException and OtherException extends from it)
- They all implements Serializable interface (so that we can serialize the exception object and save it into a file?)

## List some checked and unchecked exceptions?
- All the exceptions occur at runtime but checked exceptions are detected by the compiler at compile time so it becomes mandatory to handle them
- Checked exception (java.lang.Exception) forces programmer to handle it. Until it is handled, the compiler won't allow to run. Some of the Checked exceptions are: FileNotFoundException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, FileNotFoundException, et
- Unchecked exceptions are part of RuntimeException 
## Error
- Error is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError
- Programmer cannot do anything about it

## Multi-catch block - can you catch more than one exception in a single catch block?
- Yes, from Java 7 to newer, we can by using or | symbol



# Reflections API
## What is Reflection API?
- Java Reflection is a process of examining or modifying the run time behavior of a class at run time.
- It is a very powerful concept
- It had little use in normal programming but it's the backbone for most Java frameworks. Some of the framework uses reflection are Junit, Spring, Tomcat, Eclipse, Hibernate
- We should not use it in normal programming when we already had access to the classes and interfaces
- java.lang.Class is the entry point of all the reflection operators
```java
Test abc = new Test();
  
Class cls = abc.getClass();
System.out.println(
	cls.getName();
	cls.getConstructor().getName();
	
);
Method[] method = cls.getMethods();
```
	
## What can you do with the Reflections API that you canÂ’t do in normal code?
- Check if a class had a certain method. IDE like Eclipse able to giving us a list of methods in a class, auto complete the field because of the reflection API
- Dependency injection in Java depend heavily on reflection

	
## List some classes and methods of the Reflections API
- getClass(), getMethods(). getName(), get

## Example of using Reflection API
JDBC API uses Java Reflection API to achieve loose coupling between java programs and JDBC Drivers
	

# Design patterns
## What are Singleton / Factory design patterns?
- Creational category, revolve around the creation of objects
- A singleton pattern ensures that you always get back the same instance of whatever type you are retrieving, 
- whereas the factory pattern generally gives you a different instance of each type. Basically Factory pattern is when a method returns one of several super class that share a common super class. Use when don' know what class u'll need. Like a random enemy base on user input

2. How would you create a Singleton?

3. Explain the DAO design pattern



# JDBC
## What is JDBC?
JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. It is a relatively low-level API used to write Java code that interacts with relational databases via SQL.


## What are the core interfaces / classes in JDBC?
- `DriverManager` class: used to register a database driver
- `DataSource` interface: used to retrieve connections as an alternative to `DriverManager`
- `Connection` interface: represents the actual physical connection with the database
- `SQLException` class: this is the general exception that is thrown when something goes wrong when accessing the database
- `Statement` interface: used in order to execute SQL statements
- `PreparedStatement` interface: represents pre-compiled SQL statements (which you can also pass different parameters into)
- `CallableStatement` interface: used to execute stored procedures (user defined functions)
- `ResultSet` interface: represents data returned from the database


## What is a stored procedure and how would you call it in Java?
- Stored Procedure is a user define function in the database
- To call it in Java, we use CallableStatement instead of PreparedStatement or Statement
```java
con = DriverManager.getConnection(dburl, dbuser, dbpass);
csmt=(CallableStatement)con.prepareCall("{call InsertProc(?,?)}");
csmt.setString(1, "Intel i7 Processor");
     csmt.setString(2, "27000");
     csmt.execute();
```

## What is the difference between Statement and PreparedStatement?
- Statement takes th whole sql string
- PrepareStament take each value that need to be filled which marked as ?, and setValue to them. It is more sercure from SQL injection attack because it esacpe spacial characters

## Steps to executing an SQL query using JDBC?
- Create an sql string
- Create a Statement or preparedStatement
- If it's a prepareStament, set parameter for each ?
- If it's a select or have a returning clause, executeUpdate() the Prepare Statement and and save the result in a ResultSet obj, then use if statement with resultObj.next() to get each value in each column. If there's an array of result, use while statement with result object.next()

## How to execute stored procedures using JDBC?
- Use CallableStatement instead of PrepareStament or Statement
stored procedures | user define functions
------- | --------
may or maynot return a value | have to return something (ex: if use a delete stament, return null, update: return new when use with Trigger)
can call a function | unable to call a procedure
support try catch block | not support
cannot be used in join clause as a result set | can be use in join clause

## Which interface is responsible for transaction management?
- The Connection interface maintains a session with the database. It can be used for transaction management. It provides factory methods that returns the instance of Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement and DatabaseMetaData.



# JUnit
## What is Junit?
- Junit is a testing framework for Java

## What is TDD?
- Test driven development is a software development process relying on software development being converted to test cases before software is fully developed

## What are the annotations in JUnit? Order of execution?
- @FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING): sort all test method inside a class by name. It's a class annotation
- Life cycle annotations:
- @BeforeClass: execute some statement before all test cases. It execute before the first test method
- @BeforeEach: precondition before each test case. Exceute before the @test under it
- @Test: the void method which it attached too is a test case. Execute the test case
- @AfterEach
- @AfterAll


## Give an example of a test case
```java
public class JunitExampleTest {				

    private ArrayList<String> list;	
	
	@BeforeClass
	pubic static void beforeAll(){
		System.out.println("Junit example test class")
	}	

	@BeforeEach
	public void createAnEmptyArrayList(){
		list = new ArrayList<String>();
	}

	@Test
	public void testListSize(){
		list.add("testing");
		assertFalse(list.isEmpty());
		assertEquals(1, list.size());
	}

	@AfterEach
	public void clear list(){
		list.clear();
	}
	@BeforeEach
	public beforeTest2(){System.out.println("Before test 2")}
	@test 
	public test2(){...}
}

// Junit example test case
// array list instanciate
// testListSize result true true
// Before test 2
// test2 result				
```

# Log4j
1. What are the advantages to using a logging library?
- Logging is a powerful aid for understanding and debugging program's run-time behavior. Logs capture and persist the important data and make it available for analysis at any point in time.
- Loging libraries are popular because they run together with our application and they are portable (able to change file location) and easy to use

## What is log4j?
- log4j is a popular logging library for Java
```private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(ExampleLog4j.class);```

## What are the logging levels of log4j?
- Info, debug, warn, error, fatal
- Still in research: multiple logs files 
```
log4j.rootLogger=ALL,STDOUT,debugLog  
log4j.logger.reportsLogger=INFO,reportsLog 

-- All messages except report message
log4j.appender.debugLog=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender  
log4j.appender.debugLog.File="/Users/test/debuglog.log"

# Maven
## What is Maven?
- Maven is a dependency manager and build automation tool for Java programs. Maven project configuration and dependencies are handled using the Project Object Model, which is defined in a file called the `pom.xml` file

## What is the default Maven build lifecycle?

## Where / when does Maven retrieve dependencies from? Where are they stored locally?

## What is the POM and what is the pom.xml?
- POM is short for Project Object Model. It is the representation of a Maven project held in a file named pom.xml
- pom.xml is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project

# Advanced
## What are functional interfaces? List some that come with the JRE for Java 8

2. What are lambdas?

## What is try-with-resources? What interface must the resource implement to use this feature?
- Generally finally block is used to close all the resources (viz., file, database connection, socket or anything that should be closed after its task is done) to prevent any leaks.
- There is a possibility of the close method throwing an exception and hence it has to be surrounded in a try catch block.
- The try-with-resources statement makes sure that every opened resource is closed at the end of the statement. So a try-with-resources statement is nothing but a try statement that declares one or more resources. A resource is said to be any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable interface

4. How to make numbers in your code more readable?

## Which collections cannot hold null values?
- HashTable, implements from Map collections, because its key required to be serialize and have to be able to use .equals
- TreeSet, which needs Comparble and Comparator interface
- TreeMap's key, because its keys need to be sorted 

## If 2 interfaces have default methods and you implement both, what happens?
- Only 1 unimplemented method show up. And if we write that method, both interface satisfy

## If 2 interfaces have the same variable names and you implement both, what happens?

## Why does HashTable not take null key?
- Because HashTable serilize the key, if it takes null, it'll throw a null pointer exception

9. What new syntax for creating variables was introduced with Java 10?

10. Is there an interactive REPL tool for Java like there is for languages like Python?

## What are collection factory methods?
- They are a new features in Java 9, they allow for easy initialization of immutable collections.
- These factory methods are only available for List, Set, Map
```java
List ilist = List.of();
Map<Integer, String> map = Map.of(1,"A", 2,"B", 3,"C");
```
- Note that They are structurally immutable. Elements cannot be added, removed, or replaced. Calling any mutator method will always cause UnsupportedOperationException to be thrown. However, if the contained elements are themselves mutable, this may cause the contents to appear to change.
- They disallow null elements

## WhatÂ’s the difference between REST and SOAP services?
REST | SOAP
---- | ----
Representational State Transfer | Simple Object Access Protocol 
faster | slower
lighter | heavier
an architectural pattern | a protocol
works with plain text, html, xml, json | works only with XML
can make use of SOAP | cannot make use of REST

## What is service-oriented architecture (SOA)?
-  An SOA architecture recognizes that within an application these components are required, and creates a structure where the components themselves can exist independent of each other
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern as well as a collection of design principles that support loose coupling and reusability of different components
- loose couping is the key concept of SOA
- Common used tech to archieve SOA: WSDL, SOAP, REST
- SOA provides access to reusable components (i.e. Web services) over a Network
- Service-oriented architecture is often compared to microservices as both share the same fundamentals. Microservices, which are more recently developed than SOA, are even considered to be a type of SOA
SOA | Web service
---- | ----
creat reusable service | continuous interation and delivery is key
older | new
access common data store | each microservice has its own data repository (self-contained)

## How can you achieve loose coupling with SOA?

# Microservices
## Compare the microservice and monolithic architectures. What are the advantages / disadvantages of each?
### Monoliths: 
- Single codebase, Single process Single host, Single database, Consistent technology
- **Benefit**: 
	- Simple, one codebase- easy to find, for deployment, there's only 1 application to update. 
	- It Works well for small app, with a small dev team (2-3 members), work together for a few months, moderate visitors
- **Problem**: its scale. 
	- When codebase become big, it is very difficute to deploy: Even one small change requires downtime and break the code
	- Really difficult to scale: unable to scale horizontally and vertical scalling are expensive. Plus, the entire application have to be scalled together
	- Hard to get away from legacy code since we have to move the entire application to a new framework
### Microservices:
- Benefit:
	- Contains small services that can be owned by small development team. A rule of thumb is it should be small enough to be throw away and rewritten in a different way
	- Able to adopt new technology without the need to update anything in one go. We can choose the right tool for the job
- Ability to deploy them individually which minimize downtime and reduce risk enable frequent updates
	- Scaling: scale the services individually
	- The services can be reuse
- Challenges:
	- Complex interaction 


## Can a Java microservice communicate with a Node.js microservice? Why or why not?
- Yes. Beacause each service is independent to each other. The only thing we need is to send or received data from the REST API

## WhatÂ’s the difference between horizontal and vertical scalability? Which way do monoliths and microservices typically scale?
- Vertical scaling/ Scale up: upgrade/ add more RAM, processor (like add more seat to your car). It cost a lot of money and we are stuck with a particular vendor
- Horizontal Scalling:  adding more machines. It reduces price, easier to maintain, less downtime

## What are some best practices for building microservices?
- Centralize logging is the first and most importnt rule of micro service logging. We can use a centralize logging system like Loggly, Splunk, Stackify
- Need to implement fault torelent by break the circuit if there is no response

## What is a messaging queue and how is using one different from calling service APIs directly?
- Once we've shattered our monolith, how do we put it back together into a larger system that still makes sense? That is when static load balancing, Messaging queue, API Gateway and Service Mesh come to place
- A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in microservices architectures
- Different :
	- Message queues are asynchronous and can retry a number of times if delivery fails. 
	- When calling service API directly, if the server fails, the client handles the error. When server restart, client resend
	

6. What is a Â“replicaÂ”?

## Explain the Netflix OSS stack for microservices (Eureka, Zuul, Hystrix)
- **Netflix OSS** is a tool in the **Container Tools category** of a tech stack. It provides 5 important componants to overcome some microservies drawback which is hard to manage when there are hundreds of services
- **Netflix Eureka** : Service registration (for producer) and service discovery (for consumer). It's like a Naming server, other service lookup to consume other service
- **Netflix Ribbon** : Dynamic Routing and Load Balancer. It is an admin of multiple instances of a service. If one collapse, call the other
- ''Netflix Feign Client**: Communication among micro services
- **Netflix Zuul** : Edge/ proxy/ Gateway Server. Client gets a registered service in Eureka Registry Server using Zuul server. It's a client side load balancing
- **Netflix Hystrix** : Circuit Breaker (fault tolerance, default response when things break)
## How would you setup and configure Eureka? Zuul? Hystrix?
- ''Eureka** : 
	- Create a new Spring Boot project for Eureka, choose Eureka server dependency. Set register with Eureka and fetch-registry = false for that registry service in application.yml. For other services depend on it. Add Eureka For Client dependency, set to true for both properties
	- @EnableEurekaServer for producer, @EnableEurekaDiscovery(for consumer)
	- In application.yml of services, set default zone of service-url to Eureka register project url and its hostname will be localhost. Set application name too
	- Now, if run 2 services and eureka, information will appeared in erureka register project localhost. Should use that name with rest template to do http get, post request for department (if there's no API gateway)
- **Zuul**: 
	- Create a new project, add Erureaka Client, Gateway, Acculator. @EnableEurekaClient
	- Application ->name, cloud ->gateway ->routes with id = register name, uri = lb://register-name, predicates -> path: /user/** so every path with /user will gor to User service registered in Eureka server
	- So now when we make a http request, all request should go to Zuul gateway. /user will interact with user service 
- **Hystrix**: 
	- Get Hystrix dependency and add in Zuul Gateway.
	- @EnableEurekaServer, @EnableHystrix in Main
	- Create a controller name FallBack/Fail Controller. Use @RestController annotation, on method, use @GetMapping("userFailMethod"), create a method that return a string said please try again later
	- In application.yml, under predicates where the http path is, add filters -> name: CircuitBreaker, args -> name: register name, fallbackuri: userFailMethod (from @GetMapping)
	- Able to set timeout too. If user doesn't get a response in 4000 mili second, it'll http get to fallback path and send the fail message. hystrix->command->fallbackcmd->execution->isolation->thread->timeoutInMilliseconds

## What is the purpose of an API gateway and how does Zuul perform this?

10. What is service discovery and how does Eureka do this?

11. What is the circuit breaker pattern and how does Hystrix implement it? What are the different circuit states?

12. Is there any order in which you need to spin up these services?

## One of my microservices is throwing a TransportException! What might be the problem?
- Basically, this happens due to the wrong configuration in application.properties or application.yml.
- Either spelling mistakes, or wrong registerWithEureka and fetchRegistry value. (eureka server should set them t false, services that registry to Eureka should set to true)



# Docker
- Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
- JVM is a Application level virtualization btw

## What is containerization?
- Also called operating-system-virtualization
- A way to ship the code from 1 computer environment to other
- It ship everything we needed. Code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings, OS-level virtualization into 1 package and it's very lightweight
- Multiple cointainers can share the same runtime, system libraries, settings, OS level virtualization 

##OS level virtualization
- It like a permanent loaded on the local device
- The physical server and single instance of the operating system is virtualized into multiple isolated partitions, where each partition replicates a real server

## How are containers different from virtual machines?
Containers are often compared to Virtual Machines (VMs), since both of them allow multiple types of software to be run in contained environments
Container | Virtual machine
----- | -----
abstraction of application layer | abstraction of hardware layer
containers are lightweight because they do not require an extra load of a hypervisor. They run directly within the hostÂ’s machine. Nospace needed for virtualization | Each VM is a guess OS
Faster | Requires entire OS to be loaded before starting
more secure | less sercure
complex usage mechanism | simplier to work with

## Docker Daemon
- Docker Daemon is a server
- When you use docker run command to start up a container, your docker client will translate that command into http API call, sends it to docker daemon

## What is a Docker image? Container?
```
docker pull <image name>, 
docker images -f "dangling=false" (filter by not associate with any container), 
docker images -a (list), 
docker run <image-name> (save to a container)
```
- Docker images are templates used to create a docker cointainer
- When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided by a container image
- An image is a static representation of the app or service and its configuration and dependencies.


## List the steps to create a Docker image and spin up a container
- Create a working directory
- Create a file name DockerFile, add some info like FROM scratch/ibuntu/php:7.1
```touch DockerFile```
- Build an image
```docker build -t random-name ```
``` docker run --name container-name -p 80:80 image-name ```

## What is the relevance of the Dockerfile to this process? List some keywords in the Dockerfile
-  Docker file uses to build a Docker image. It is a The Docker file is a text-based script
```docker
FROM --platform=<platform> <image-name>
RUN apt-get update
```

## What is the benefit to an image being built in Layers?
- We can commit our changes. Docker Layer works like a version cotrol system

## What are some other Docker commands?
- docker commit -m""
- exit
- docker push localhost:5000/ubuntu
- // local host:5000/ubuntu is a tag
- docker tag image-name tag-name
- docker image ls

## What is a container registry? How would you retrieve and upload images to DockerHub?
- The registry is like a bookshelf where images are stored and available to be pulled
- docker image pull image-name:tag-name, docker pull tag-name 
- docker image push [tag-name]

22. What is Docker compose and why is it useful?
- Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications as a single service. With Compose, you use a DockerCompose.yml file to configure your applicationÂ’s services
- Benefits: Single host deployment, easy to use, reduce times
```
#start all service
Docker Compose up
#Stop all
Docker compose down
#Scall a service
Docker Compose up -d -scale
```

23. If you want to store state for a container, how does Docker recommend doing that?
